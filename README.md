# Delique
A free and open-source GNU/Linux distribution derived from the procedures in the Linux From Scratch book, aimed at efficiency, valuable features, and integration with the NsCDE desktop environment.

Delique is in rather early stages of development, and must be regarded as experimental until further notice. Do not expect much of a complete operating system over the next few months. Additionally, Delique is not only a product of the Linux From Scratch book and has already begun to deviate from its procedures where necessary. You are now aware of the state of the Delique operating system.
